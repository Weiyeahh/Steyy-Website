[11/28/21, 12:59:55 AM] Yashna: 82.4
[11/28/21, 1:00:05 AM] Yashna: Also you have my slippers
[11/28/21, 1:02:31 AM] Yashna: Also, you need to stop saying that “I’ll pay you.” It makes it feel like you are a superior. We are all equals here 
Walking from map’s back entrance is the same distance for you (in fact less)
[11/28/21, 1:03:03 AM] Yashna: The value you hold for money may not be the same value others hold for it
[11/28/21, 1:09:08 AM] Yashna: Also, can you WhatsApp the pictures/videos in my album?
[11/28/21, 2:02:31 AM] Yashna: Was just thinking about it..
I had absolutely no intention of saying you cheated or something. I was just trying to analyse the acceptance of students from across the world at Babson.
You know that how much I appreciate about how hard working you are and even go around telling people that 
Sorry if it came across that way
[11/28/21, 10:23:46 AM] Weiye: It’s just we always discussed about dropping off each of us in one spot after another and I wasn’t sure which slope near map you were talking about
[11/28/21, 10:24:47 AM] Weiye: Absolutely we are all equal, it’s just I don’t want risk walking in the cold wind and if you think the extra charge is it acceptable then if it generates because of me I will cover it
[11/28/21, 10:25:02 AM] Weiye: **not acceptable
[11/28/21, 10:25:12 AM] Weiye: I do
[11/28/21, 10:25:51 AM] Weiye: Wow did he add extra charges in the end? Or it’s the readings on the meter? Cause I remember it was still 59 something in Hollister
[11/28/21, 10:26:22 AM] Weiye: Thanks, I might have over reacted too
[11/28/21, 10:50:23 AM] Yashna: Yeah you did
[11/28/21, 10:50:37 AM] Yashna: He added 8 for toll and then 15-20% tax
[11/28/21, 10:53:28 AM] Weiye: Ask anyone, lol I didn’t want to argue, so I say that just to be polite. Think before you speak, maybe.
[11/28/21, 10:55:56 AM] Yashna: I’d say you ask anyone. You misunderstood me. You thought the negative way. Moreover, we roast each other in terrible ways (so another way of thinking positively was that). 
In fact, I was being polite by apologising now. You didn’t even do that 
You should think before typing/speaking maybe
[11/28/21, 11:09:37 AM] Yashna: Also, can you WhatsApp the pictures and videos to me
[11/28/21, 3:06:32 PM] Weiye: When do you want your slippers back?
[11/28/21, 3:06:40 PM] Weiye: Can use my phone for airdrop at that time
[11/28/21, 3:06:55 PM] Weiye: I tried whatsup can only send 30 pic a time
[11/28/21, 3:17:44 PM] Yashna: In the library 
Can you come here
[11/28/21, 3:17:46 PM] Yashna: Okay
[11/28/21, 3:54:36 PM] Weiye: Can I drop them off at van
[11/28/21, 3:54:43 PM] Weiye: Cause I want to go to the gym later
[11/28/21, 4:07:48 PM] Yashna: What time are you planning to go
[11/28/21, 4:10:10 PM] Weiye: Around 4:30?
[11/28/21, 4:10:22 PM] Weiye: When are you coming back?
[11/28/21, 4:10:28 PM] Yashna: I’m in the library 
Gonna stay here for a while
[11/28/21, 4:11:08 PM] Weiye: Do you want to join us in trim at 6?

[11/30/21, 1:30:32 AM] Yashna: Also, can you help me move out my things to my aunts place
[11/30/21, 1:35:31 AM] Yashna: Also why are you acting so formallll
